## Understanding The Page


Before we delve into the next set of configs, let’s first understand the most common sections present in a search results page or category landing page.  
A search results page or a category landing page is made up of the following set of sections:

1.  Products list section
    1.  View type could be grid or list view
    2.  Sort by widget
    3.  Pagination widget with no. of products per page control
    4.  Pagination could be an infinite scroll or page number based
    5.  Number of results loaded on a page
2.  Facets section
3.  Spell check / search results message section
4.  Merchandising banners section  
      
    

Here is a graphical representation of the various sections on a search results page:

In the following sections, we will discuss how to configure and render each of these features with the Unbxd Search JS Library.



## Nomenclature

You will see below terms more:

*   `el` – The term el refers to a DOM element. So the rendered component will be rendered inside this DOM element.  
    Ex: document.getElementById(“searchResultsWrapper”).

*   `template` – templates are functions where you can return the HTML string that needs to be rendered. This provides you the power of entire Javascript to build your desired HTML string
*   All of the class names generated by the library will have the prefix **“UNX-“**. So you can use it to customize styles.
*   All templates are provided as functions where you can return the HTML string that needs to be rendered. This provides you the power of entire Javascript to build your desired HTML string.
*   All of the classnames generated by the library will have the prefix `UNX-`. So you can use it to customize styles.
*   `tagName` -will be html element wrapper created by the sdk, by default it will be “DIV”. If the template required wrapper element changes we can customise here.
*   `htmlAttributes` -its an object where you can customise the html attributes like class, id and data-*. key will be attribute name and value will be attribute value.
*   `events` - this is an object you can add your own events to it. key will be event name(click) and value should be a function.
