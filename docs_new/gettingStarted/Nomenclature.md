You will see below terms more:

*   `el` – The term el refers to a DOM element. So the rendered component will be rendered inside this DOM element.  
    Ex: document.getElementById(“searchResultsWrapper”).

*   `template` – templates are functions where you can return the HTML string that needs to be rendered. This provides you the power of entire Javascript to build your desired HTML string
*   All of the class names generated by the library will have the prefix **“UNX-“**. So you can use it to customize styles.
