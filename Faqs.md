The choice of pagination method depends on the specific needs of the website and its target audience. A fixed pagination with next and previous buttons and numbers is a suitable option for most e-commerce websites. Infinite scroll pagination can work well for websites with a large number of products and a high volume of traffic. A click and scroll with load more button can be a good option for websites that want to limit the amount of data loaded at once.
