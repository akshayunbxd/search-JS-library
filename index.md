Unbxd Javascript Search SDK is a software development kit that allows e-commerce websites to easily integrate with Unbxd’s search and product discovery platform. It provides an easy-to-use JavaScript API that can be used to configure, initiate, and customize search requests, including:

1. Setting the API and Site Key
2. Initating the search
3. Retrieving the autocomplete suggestions
4. Tracking various search and product events

To use Unbxd Javascript Search SDK it would typically be integrated on the e-commerce website, specifically on the search bar, the product listing and product detail pages, and other related areas, where search and product discovery functionality is required.

It's important to note that the nomenclature and the elements present on the e-commerce page may vary across different website, but the Unbxd Javascript Search SDK can be integrated in any e-commerce website.

For the older version, [refer to the documentation here](https://unbxd.com/docs/site-search/integration-documentation/jssdk-documentation/). Since we are gradually migrating all our customers toward our new upgraded console, we would slowly deprecate the older version.
