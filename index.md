> IMPORTANT: This document is ONLY for the customers using the new console. For the older version, [refer to the documentation here](https://unbxd.com/docs/site-search/integration-documentation/jssdk-documentation/). Since we are gradually migrating all our customers toward our new upgraded console, we would slowly deprecate the older version.Â
